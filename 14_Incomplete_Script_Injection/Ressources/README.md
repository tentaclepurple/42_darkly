### explanation

This is a type of vulnerability where a user can inject a script or code into an application through input fields, but the script is intentionally or unintentionally incomplete. This can happen if the application does not properly handle or sanitize the input before processing it.

Example: An attacker might submit an input like <script>alert (with a missing closing tag) in a feedback form.

Common Causes:
 - Improper Input Sanitization: The application fails to adequately sanitize or escape user inputs, allowing incomplete or malformed scripts to cause unintended behavior.
 - Faulty Error Handling: The application might display sensitive information, like flags, in error messages or debug information when it encounters unexpected inputs.
 - Inadequate Validation: The input validation mechanisms are not robust enough to handle or reject incomplete or unexpected inputs correctly.

### How to Prevent This Vulnerability

- Robust Input Validation: Implement strict validation rules to ensure that inputs conform to expected formats and reject any that do not.
- Proper Sanitization: Escape or remove potentially dangerous characters and scripts from user inputs.
- Secure Error Handling: Avoid displaying sensitive information or flags in error messages. Instead, provide generic error messages to users.
