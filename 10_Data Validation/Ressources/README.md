### explanation
In the HTML code of the page, there are some values that you can modify.
					<SELECT name=‘valeur’ onChange=‘javascript:this.form.submit();’>
						<option value=‘99999999999’>42</option>
In the value parameter you add or change to a very high numerical value, you get the flag.
Errors generated by extreme values can sometimes expose internal details of the server or application that should not be visible.

### How to Prevent This Vulnerability

- Server-Side Validation: 
    - On the server, validate that the input data is within the expected range before processing.

- Data Sanitisation: 
    - Be sure to sanitise all input data to prevent injections and other attacks.
