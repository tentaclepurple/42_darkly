### explanation

On inspecting the page ‘http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f’, I found some interesting comments, two of which are as follows

- You must come from : ‘https://www.nsa.gov/’.
- Let's use this browser : ‘ft_bornToSec’. It will help you a lot

Searching for information, there are two ways to use the header of a request, the address is the Referer, and the other is to use it as USER-AGENT, as the browser of the request.

When I send the request with the visual thunder application, I get a page with the flag on it.

- A : Specify the User-Agent
- e : Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP server

Command:

    curl -A "ft_bornToSec" -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" "http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f"

# Description:

Header-Based Access Control: This vulnerability occurs when a web server displays special or sensitive content based on specific HTTP headers such as User-Agent or Referer. In your case, the server reveals the flag only if the correct HTTP headers are used in the request.

### Protection Against the Vulnerability

1. Proper Validation and Authentication:

- Authentication: Ensure that access to sensitive resources is protected by robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, not just header validation.

- Authorization: Implement proper access controls on the server to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive content.

2. Request Validation:

- HTTP Headers: Do not base protection or delivery of sensitive content solely on HTTP headers. Headers can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

- Content Validation: Use robust business logic and content validation methods to protect critical resources.

3. Server Security Configuration:

- Configuration Review: Review server configuration to ensure there is no business logic based on HTTP headers that could be exploited.

 - Additional Security: Implement additional security policies, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), to detect and mitigate potential attacks.
